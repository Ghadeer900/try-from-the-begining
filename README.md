## Payback Time and Annual Revenue Calculation

The project's annual revenue from produced electricity is calculated using:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{E_{year}}{1000} \times 128.8
$$

Where:
- $R_{year}$ is the yearly revenue in dollars.
- $E_{year}$ is the total energy generated yearly in watt-hours (Wh).
- 128.8 is the price in dollars per 1000 kWh (where 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).

The payback time $T$ (in years) is calculated as:

$$
T = \frac{\text{Total Project Cost}}{R_{year}}
$$

Where:
- **Total Project Cost** is the full installation and equipment cost.
- $R_{year}$ is as defined above.

### Example:

If your system generates $E_{year} = 40\,000$ Wh per year, the yearly revenue is:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{40\,000}{1000} \times 128.8 = 40 \times 128.8 = 5\,152\,\text{USD}
$$

If the total project cost is $59\,000$ USD, the payback time is:

$$
T = \frac{59\,000}{5\,152} \approx 11.46\,\text{years}
$$

## ROI (Return on Investment) Calculation

ROI is a measure of the efficiency and profitability of an investment. In our project, it represents the percentage return earned on the total cost of the energy storage system.

The formula for ROI is:

$$
ROI = \frac{R_{year} - C_{total}}{C_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

Where:
- $ROI$ is the Return on Investment (as a percentage).
- $R_{year}$ is the total revenue or savings generated per year.
- $C_{total}$ is the total initial project cost (investment).

### Example Calculation

Suppose:
- $R_{year} = \$5,152$ (annual revenue from electricity)
- $C_{total} = \$59,000$ (total project cost)

Then:

$$
ROI = \frac{5,152 - 59,000}{59,000} \times 100\% = \frac{-53,848}{59,000} \times 100\% \approx -91.3\%
$$
