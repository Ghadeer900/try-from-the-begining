## Payback Time and Annual Revenue Calculation

The project's annual revenue from produced electricity is calculated using:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{E_{year}}{1000} \times 128.8
$$

Where:
- $R_{year}$ is the yearly revenue in dollars.
- $E_{year}$ is the total energy generated yearly in watt-hours (Wh).
- 128.8 is the price in dollars per 1000 kWh (where 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).

The payback time $T$ (in years) is calculated as:

$$
T = \frac{\text{Total Project Cost}}{R_{year}}
$$

Where:
- **Total Project Cost** is the full installation and equipment cost.
- $R_{year}$ is as defined above.

### Example:

If your system generates $E_{year} = 40\,000$ Wh per year, the yearly revenue is:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{40\,000}{1000} \times 128.8 = 40 \times 128.8 = 5\,152\,\text{USD}
$$

If the total project cost is $59\,000$ USD, the payback time is:

$$
T = \frac{59\,000}{5\,152} \approx 11.46\,\text{years}
$$

## ROI Calculation Method

ROI formula for your project:

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} \times 100
$$

### our study case

- **Power used per day:** $17\, \text{LEDs} \times 40\,\text{W} \times 6\,\text{h} = 4,080\,\text{Wh/day} = 4.08\,\text{kWh/day}$
- **Yearly usage:** $4.08\,\text{kWh/day} \times 365 = 1,489.2\,\text{kWh/year}$
- **Annual value at $128$/1,000 kWh:** 
  $$
  \text{Annual Value} = \frac{1,489.2}{1,000} \times 128 = \$190.63
  $$

### Homs City Data

- **Total investment cost:** \$8,648
- **Annual energy output:** $1,489.2\,\text{kWh/year}$
- **Estimated benefit:** $\$190.63$

### ROI for Year 1:

$$
ROI_{\text{Year 1}} = \frac{190.63}{8,648} \times 100 \approx 2.2\\%
$$

### ROI After 2 Years

Assuming similar annual revenue the ROI after 2 years is:

$$
ROI_{\text{Year 2}} = \frac{2 \times 190.63}{8,648} \times 100 \approx 4.4\\%
$$

This assumes revenue accumulates linearly and no extra costs occur during the 2 years.
