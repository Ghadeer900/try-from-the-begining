# Payback Time Calculation

The payback time is the duration it takes for the project to recover its initial investment through generated revenues or savings.

## Formula for Payback Time

We calculate the payback time \( T \) using the formula:

\[
T = Initial Investment/Annual Net Profit
\]

Where:
- Initial Investment is the total cost of setting up the system.
- Annual Net Profit is the yearly income or savings generated by the system.

## Project Specific Calculation

For our gravity-based energy storage project:

- The electrical energy generated per cycle is calculated by the mechanical potential energy of the mass:

\[
E{mech} = m*g*h
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass (in kg),
- \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration (\(9.81 \, m/s^2\)),
- \( h \) is the height the mass is lifted (in meters).

- Accounting for system efficiency \( \eta \), the usable electrical energy per cycle is:

\[
E{elec} = \eta*E{mech}
\]

- The total energy generated annually is:

\[
E{year} = E{elec} \times \text{cycles per year}
\]

- Using the local electricity price ($128.8 per 1000 kWh), the annual revenue is:

\[
R_{year} = {E_{year}}*128.8 / 1000
\]

- Finally, the payback time is:

\[
T = \frac{\text{Total Project Cost}}{R_{year}}
\]

## Example Values

- Mass, \( m = 11.2 \, kg \)
- Height, \( h = 1.05 \, m \)
- Efficiency, \( eta = 0.8 \)
- Cycles per year estimated based on traffic data.
- Total Project Cost from cost analysis.

With these values, the payback time calculates to approximately 11.6 years.
