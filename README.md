## Payback Time and Annual Revenue Calculation

The project's annual revenue from produced electricity is calculated using:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{E_{year}}{1000} \times 128.8
$$

Where:
- $R_{year}$ is the yearly revenue in dollars.
- $E_{year}$ is the total energy generated yearly in watt-hours (Wh).
- 128.8 is the price in dollars per 1000 kWh (where 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).

The payback time $T$ (in years) is calculated as:

$$
T = \frac{\text{Total Project Cost}}{R_{year}}
$$

Where:
- **Total Project Cost** is the full installation and equipment cost.
- $R_{year}$ is as defined above.

### Example:

If your system generates $E_{year} = 40\,000$ Wh per year, the yearly revenue is:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{40\,000}{1000} \times 128.8 = 40 \times 128.8 = 5\,152\,\text{USD}
$$

If the total project cost is $59\,000$ USD, the payback time is:

$$
T = \frac{59\,000}{5\,152} \approx 11.46\,\text{years}
$$
