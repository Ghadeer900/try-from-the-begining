## Payback Time and Annual Revenue Calculation

The project's annual revenue from produced electricity is calculated using:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{E_{year}}{1000} \times 128.8
$$

Where:
- $R_{year}$ is the yearly revenue in dollars.
- $E_{year}$ is the total energy generated yearly in watt-hours (Wh).
- 128.8 is the price in dollars per 1000 kWh (where 1 kWh = 1000 Wh).

The payback time $T$ (in years) is calculated as:

$$
T = \frac{\text{Total Project Cost}}{R_{year}}
$$

Where:
- **Total Project Cost** is the full installation and equipment cost.
- $R_{year}$ is as defined above.

### Example:

If your system generates $E_{year} = 40\,000$ Wh per year, the yearly revenue is:

$$
R_{year} = \frac{40\,000}{1000} \times 128.8 = 40 \times 128.8 = 5\,152\,\text{USD}
$$

If the total project cost is $59\,000$ USD, the payback time is:

$$
T = \frac{59\,000}{5\,152} \approx 11.46\,\text{years}
$$

## ROI (Return on Investment) Calculation

Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the profitability and efficiency of your investment. It is always presented as a percentage.

### Formula

The most common formula for ROI is:

$$
ROI = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Cost of Investment}} \times 100\%
$$

Where:
- Net Profit = Total Revenue or Savings $-$ Total Cost of Investment
- Total Cost of Investment = All costs needed to build and run the system

Or, equivalently:

$$
ROI = \frac{R_{year} - C_{total}}{C_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

Where:
- $R_{year}$ is the revenue or savings earned over a year (or another period)
- $C_{total}$ is the total initial investment

### Example
If your project cost \$59,000 and earns \$5,152 per year:

$$
\text{Net Profit} = 5,152 - 59,000 = -53,848
$$

$$
ROI = \frac{-53,848}{59,000} \times 100\% \approx -91.3\%
$$
